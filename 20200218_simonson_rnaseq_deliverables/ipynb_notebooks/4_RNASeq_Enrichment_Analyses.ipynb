    "\"Enrichment analysis\" is an umbrella term for a class of analyses that investigate whether a gene set of interest (usually those found to be significant in an upstream analysis such as differential expression testing) are found to be \"enriched\" an annotated gene set (such as the set of genes in a particular pathway).  Enrichment can be determined in a number of different ways, with the most common being over-representation analysis (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Over-representation analysis simply compares gene lists, determining whether the genes in the gene set of interest are present in the annotated gene set in a significantly higher number (or a significantly lower number) than one would statistically expect by chance given the size and content of the two sets and the reference set from which they are drawn.  In this sort of analyis, the statistical validity of the outcome depends critically on the choice of correct reference set, which represents the set of genes from which the genes of interest can be drawn; while it is easy (and tempting) to use all the genes in the organism being examined as the reference set, this is almost certainly an over-estimate--which will lead to over-estimates of the significance of any enrichment found--and thus should be replaced with a more realistic number such as the number of genes actually detectable in the RNASeq experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, gene set enrichment analysis makes use of not only the identities of the genes of interest but also their scores (such their differential expression fold-changes): the genes of interest are ranked by their scores, and the GSEA algorithm ([7](#Citations)) determines whether the subset of genes of interest that are also part of the chosen annotated set (e.g., a particular pathway) are localized toward the top or the bottom of this ranked list.  For example, if genes from a particular pathway are found to lie preferentially near the top of a list of genes differentially expressed in treatment versus control that has been ranked by decreasing fold-change, then this suggests that this pathway is UP-regulated in the treatment compared to the control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrichment analyses such as ORA and GSEA can be performed using a wide range of different annotated sets. The most commonly used is the Gene Ontology (GO; [8](#Citation)), in which case the resulting analysis is often referred to as a \"functional enrichment analysis\" since it examines the enrichment of particular biological functions (as annotated in the GO) in the gene set of interest.  As discussed earlier, enrichment analysis can also be performed using pathways (from sources such as KEGG ([6](#Citation)) as the annotated gene set, in which case it may be called \"pathway enrichment analysis\"."
